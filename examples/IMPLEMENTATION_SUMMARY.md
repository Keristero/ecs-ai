# Text Adventure Game - Implementation Summary

## âœ… Completed Implementation

### 1. ECS Components (examples/text_adventure_logic/components/text_adventure_components.mjs)
Created comprehensive ECS components for the game:
- **Basic Components**: Hitpoints, Name, Description, Attributes
- **Entity Types**: Room, Item, Landmark, Enemy, Player
- **Relationships**: Connection (between rooms), Inventory (item ownership)

### 2. Player Actions (examples/text_adventure_logic/actions/)
Separated player-initiated actions into their own modules:
- **move.mjs**: Navigate between rooms via connections
- **look.mjs**: Examine current room and inventory
- **pickup.mjs**: Pick up items from the room
- **drop.mjs**: Drop items into the room
- **attack.mjs**: Combat with enemies

Each action is automatically exposed as an API endpoint.

### 3. Automated Systems (examples/text_adventure_logic/systems/)
Kept only automated game logic that runs after player actions:
- **enemy_turn_system**: Enemies attack players in the same room
- **InRoom relation**: Tracks which entities are in which rooms

### 4. Game World Initialization (examples/text_adventure_logic/setup_world.mjs)
Created initial game world with:
- 3 interconnected rooms (Starting Cave, Forest Path, Ancient Ruins)
- 2 items (rusty sword, health potion)
- 2 enemies (goblin, skeleton warrior)
- 1 landmark (ancient altar)
- 1 player character with stats
- String store for names and descriptions

### 5. Actions Framework (game_framework/actions_interface.mjs)
Built automatic action loading and exposure system:
- Scans the actions folder for .mjs files
- Parses JSDoc comments for documentation
- Automatically exposes each action as a POST endpoint
- Provides action listing at /actions endpoint

### 6. API Server Integration (api/server.mjs)
Extended the API server to support actions:
- Auto-loads actions on server start
- Creates /actions endpoints alongside /tools
- Handles action execution with proper error handling
- Distinguishes between actions (player-initiated) and tools (ECS inspection)

### 7. HTML Client (examples/text_adventure_client/)
Complete browser-based terminal interface:
- **index.html**: Retro terminal UI with green-on-black styling
- **client.js**: Full game client with:
  - Command parsing and execution
  - Contextual autocomplete (Tab completion)
  - Command history (Up/Down arrows)
  - Real-time room updates
  - Error handling and user feedback
  - Support for all game actions

## Architecture Benefits

### Separation of Concerns
- **Actions**: Player-initiated, exposed via API
- **Systems**: Automated game logic, runs after actions
- **Components**: Pure data storage
- **Setup**: World initialization

### Extensibility
- Add new actions by creating a file in actions/ folder
- Add new systems by exporting functions from systems/
- Add new components by defining them in components/
- All actions automatically become API endpoints

### API-First Design
- All game interactions via REST API
- Client is stateless HTML/JS
- Actions can be called from curl, web client, or AI agents
- Enables multiplayer, AI NPCs, and external tools

## Usage

### Start Server
```bash
cd /home/keristero/Documents/repos/ecs-ai
GAME_LOGIC_FOLDER_PATH=./examples/text_adventure_logic pnpm start
```

Server starts on:
- API: http://127.0.0.1:6060
- MCP: http://127.0.0.1:6061

### Open Client
Open examples/text_adventure_client/index.html in a browser, or serve it:
```bash
cd examples/text_adventure_client
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

### Test Actions via API
```bash
# Look around
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:6060/actions/look \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"playerId": 1}'

# Move north
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:6060/actions/move \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"playerId": 1, "direction": "north"}'

# List all actions
curl http://127.0.0.1:6060/actions
```

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

1. **AI Integration**: Use /agent/prompt to generate dynamic room descriptions
2. **Persistence**: Save/load game state
3. **More Content**: Additional rooms, items, enemies, and quests
4. **Combat System**: Enhanced combat with special abilities
5. **Character Progression**: Experience points and leveling
6. **Multiplayer**: Support for multiple simultaneous players
7. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket support for live game updates
8. **Admin Tools**: Web-based world editor
