## 🚀 Running Tests

```bash
# Client tests only
pnpm test:client

# All tests (server + client)
pnpm test
```

## 📦 Dependencies Added

- `jsdom@^25.0.1` - DOM environment for Node.js testing

## 🎯 Test Philosophy

The tests focus on **pure logic validation** rather than DOM manipulation:
- ✅ Fast execution (~100ms)
- ✅ No browser required
- ✅ No network dependencies
- ✅ Easy to maintain
- ✅ Serves as documentation

## 📚 Documentation

Each test file includes:
- Clear test descriptions
- Example usage patterns
- Edge case handling
- Error condition testing

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

See `TESTING_STRATEGY.md` for:
- Integration testing plans
- E2E testing with Puppeteer
- Client refactoring suggestions
- Test pyramid approach

## ✨ Benefits

1. **Regression Prevention**: Catches bugs before they reach production
2. **Documentation**: Tests show how each feature should work
3. **Refactoring Safety**: Can refactor with confidence
4. **CI/CD Ready**: Easy to integrate into automated pipelines
5. **Developer Experience**: Fast feedback loop

## 🎓 Best Practices Demonstrated

- ✅ Descriptive test names
- ✅ Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- ✅ One concept per test
- ✅ Independent tests (no shared state)
- ✅ Edge case coverage
- ✅ Clear test organization
