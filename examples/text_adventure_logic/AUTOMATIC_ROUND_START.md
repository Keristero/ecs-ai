# Automatic Round Start Implementation

## Overview
The game now automatically starts the first round when it initializes, putting the game into a ready-to-play state immediately upon startup.

## Changes Made

### 1. Game Initialization (`examples/text_adventure_logic/game.mjs`)
Added automatic round start after event queue initialization:
```javascript
// Start the first round automatically
await startRound(game.eventQueue)
```

### 2. Helper Function Extraction (`examples/text_adventure_logic/helpers/player_turn_helper.mjs`)
**Problem**: The `endPlayerTurn` function was being loaded as a system and called automatically during event processing, causing errors.

**Solution**: Moved `endPlayerTurn` to a separate helper file outside the systems directory:
- Created `helpers/player_turn_helper.mjs` with the `endPlayerTurn` function
- Updated imports in `player_action_helper.mjs` and tests
- Removed `endPlayerTurn` from `systems/player_turn_system.mjs`

### 3. System Updates
**`systems/player_turn_system.mjs`**:
- Now only exports `player_turn_system` (no helper functions)
- Updated comment to reference the new helper location

## Game Startup State

When the game starts, it now automatically:
1. ✅ Initializes the game world with all entities
2. ✅ Creates the event queue
3. ✅ Starts the first round (`round_start` event)
4. ✅ Begins the first turn (player's turn with highest initiative)
5. ✅ Sets `game.waitingForPlayerInput = true`
6. ✅ Waits for the player to perform an action via the API

## Example Startup State
```
✅ Game loaded successfully
✅ Round started: true
✅ Number of actors: 4 (1 player + 3 enemies)
✅ Current actor index: 0 (player's turn)
✅ Waiting for player input: true
✅ Events queued: 2 (round_start, turn_start)
```

## Turn Flow

### Player Turn:
1. Game starts → Player's turn begins (highest initiative)
2. `game.waitingForPlayerInput = true`
3. API/Client waits for player action
4. Player performs action (e.g., speak, move, use)
5. Action creates an event → queued and processed by systems
6. Client calls `endPlayerTurn(game)` from `helpers/player_turn_helper.mjs`
7. Next actor's turn begins

### NPC Turn:
1. NPC turn starts
2. `npc_turn_system` automatically executes AI logic
3. NPC performs action (e.g., attack player)
4. `endTurn` is called automatically
5. Next actor's turn begins (or round ends)

## Architecture Benefits

### Separation of Concerns:
- **Systems**: React to events, return new events
- **Helpers**: Utility functions for manual API calls
- **Event Queue**: Manages turn order and event processing

### No Manual Round Management:
- Game is immediately playable after startup
- No need for API to call `startRound()`
- Turn progression happens automatically

### Clear Player Input Model:
- Game pauses at player turns
- `waitingForPlayerInput` flag is clear signal to API
- Player actions come through API, not automated

## Testing

All 15 actor turn system tests pass:
```bash
node --test tests/text_adventure/actor_turn_system.test.mjs
✅ 15/15 tests passing
```

Tests cover:
- Initialization and actor sorting
- Event queue processing
- Turn tracking
- Player turn system behavior
- NPC turn system behavior

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Auto-restart rounds when current round ends
2. Add round counter to track game progression
3. Add turn timeout for player turns (auto-skip if no input)
4. Add spectator mode to watch NPCs battle
5. Add pause/resume functionality
